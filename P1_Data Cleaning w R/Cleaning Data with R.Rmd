> First the library and data need to be loaded into R Note: This walkthrough is from
https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-with-r-and-the-tidyverse-detecting-missing-values-ea23c519bc62 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#set the working directory
file_loc <- paste(getwd(), "/raw_data", sep="")
setwd(file_loc)

# read csv file
df <- read_csv("telecom.csv")
```

> The "glimpse" function shows the variable names and types.

```{r}
glimpse(df)
```

> The "dplyr" library is used for data manipulation. The first example will demonstrate the use of filter to show all customers who have Churn values equal to "yes".

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(Churn == "yes")
```
